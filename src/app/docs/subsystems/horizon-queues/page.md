title: Horizon queues
---

Horizon is the consumer side of every workload Kraite dispatches. Where the [dispatch daemon](/docs/subsystems/dispatch-daemon) is the brain that decides what runs and when, Horizon queues are the muscle that does the actual exchange round-trips, indicator math, and DB writes. Horizon runs on **six boxes** — athena (single-purpose user-data-stream supervisor only), plus the five dedicated workers eos, iris, nyx, hemera, and tyche — and each one consumes a deliberately different slice of the queue surface. {% .lead %}

This is the **subsystem lens** view. For the per-server worker counts in physical terms, see the [server architecture overview](/docs/servers/architecture-overview).

## The seven queues

Every job dispatched in Kraite lands in one of seven queues:

| Queue | What lives here |
|---|---|
| `cronjobs` | Top-level scheduled commands' job graph entry points (the `kraite:cron-*` tree) |
| `user-data-stream` | `ProcessUserDataEventJob` frames coming off the Binance user-data WebSocket daemon |
| `positions` | Position-block atomics — open / close / WAP / sync individual position state machines |
| `orders` | Per-exchange order-placement and cancel atomics (the chatty queue — every `Place*OrderJob` and `Cancel*Job`) |
| `priority` | Hot-path replacements when a position needs immediate re-orchestration (manual close detected, drift, etc.) |
| `indicators` | TAAPI-bound symbol indicator computation jobs (rate-limit-sensitive) |
| `<hostname>` | Per-host queues for jobs that *must* run on the box that dispatched them (rare; supervisor stays warm) |

## Per-server worker layout

Worker counts per queue per server. Empty cells mean that server doesn't consume that queue at all:

| Queue | Athena | Eos | Iris | Nyx | Hemera | Tyche |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `user-data-stream` | 5 | — | — | — | — | — |
| `cronjobs` | — | — | — | — | — | 3 |
| `positions` | — | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | — |
| `orders` | — | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | — |
| `priority` | — | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | — |
| `indicators` | — | — | — | — | — | 10 |
| `<hostname>` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

```
        Redis (single instance, hosted on Hyperion)
  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ user-data  cronjobs  positions  orders  priority │
  │                                       indicators │
  └────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──┘
       ▼          ▼         ▼          ▼          ▼
   ┌──────┐  ┌─────┐  ┌────────────────┐ ┌────────────────┐┌─────┐
   │Athena│  │Tyche│  │ Eos + Iris     │ │ Eos + Iris     ││Tyche│
   │  x5  │  │ x3  │  │ + Nyx + Hemera │ │ + Nyx + Hemera ││ x10 │
   └──────┘  └─────┘  │  x5 each       │ │  x8 each       │└─────┘
                      └────────────────┘ └────────────────┘
```

Eos, Iris, Nyx, and Hemera are deliberately identical — split only by Binance account range to carve the per-IP weight budget across four independent IPs. Tyche is the only consumer of `indicators` because TAAPI rate-limit accounting lives in one place; adding a second consumer would silently double the request rate.

## Why athena only consumes `user-data-stream`

{% callout title="Architectural decision" %}
Athena is the ingestion brain — it owns the scheduler, the dispatch daemon, both WebSocket daemons, and the public web vhosts. The one Horizon pool it hosts (`user-data-stream`, 5 processes) drains the push frames produced by the Binance user-data daemon running on the same box, so the frame-to-job-execution path stays inside one machine. Every other queue (positions / orders / priority / indicators / cronjobs) lives on a dedicated worker box so a slow exchange round-trip or a TAAPI rate-limit wait never competes with the scheduler or the dispatch daemon for CPU. The previous fleet's "athena holds a small self-sufficiency footprint on every queue" pattern was retired with the 2026-05-24 fleet rebuild — workers being briefly offline during a deploy now degrades capacity rather than triggering a self-rescue path that was never load-tested.

## Redis isolation

Every server runs Horizon against the **same Redis** (on hyperion), but each one sets a unique `HORIZON_PREFIX` so its supervisor key, metrics, and tags never collide with another server's. Horizon also uses `HORIZON_ENV` (not `APP_ENV`) to pick which supervisor block in `config/horizon.php` applies — every box runs `APP_ENV=production`, but `HORIZON_ENV=athena` / `eos` / `iris` / `nyx` / `tyche` selects a completely different worker layout.

```
APP_ENV        = production       (everywhere — picks DB, env behaviour)
HORIZON_ENV    = athena | eos | iris | nyx | hemera | tyche  (supervisor block)
HORIZON_PREFIX = kraite_athena_horizon:        (per-host Redis key namespace)
```

Mixing these up is the most common cause of a "Horizon is up but no jobs are processing" report — usually `HORIZON_ENV` got left at a previous server's value during a hostname migration.

## What Horizon doesn't own

- **Scheduling.** The Laravel scheduler and the [dispatch daemon](/docs/subsystems/dispatch-daemon) are independent supervisors. Restarting Horizon does not interrupt either.
- **Stream daemons.** `kraite:stream-binance-user-data` and `kraite:stream-binance-prices` run under supervisor as long-lived processes — they *dispatch* into Horizon but are not Horizon-managed.
- **Step state machine.** Horizon executes the atomic `Job` payload; the step record's lifecycle (Pending / Dispatched / Running / Completed / Failed / …) is owned by the dispatch daemon and the step-dispatcher package.
